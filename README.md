# PrepPrivateStat545a
This is a ReadMe file that will be for my Private Repo for the UBC class STAT 545a
At the moment I don't have access to it, so I'm making someething I can hopefully copy and paste.

To make a readme I can work on in preparation for the private repo


2015/18/09 1430hrs.  I've pulled the README.md file from the public repo PrepPrivateStat545a on GitHub to my personal computer.

Hi, I'm Adrian.  
I'm a new student in the Masters of Statistics program.  I did my undergrad several years ago in Environmental Science with a minor in Statistics.  Since then I've gravitated more towards data manipulation and processing as a very enjoyable work, despite the many frustrations.  I first encountered this sort of activity in a 200 level introduction to MATLAB course and haven't looked back since.

I spend most of my hobby time doing european historical marial arts, focussing primarily on the rapier (a al Princess Bride) though I also dabble in sidesword, longsword and poleaxe.

I also enjoy tabletop gaming.  Smallworld is probably my favourite board game, and Shadowrun is currently my preferred pen and paper RPG.
