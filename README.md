# PrepPrivateStat545a

###Purpose  or is that Porpoise?
This is a ReadMe file that will be for the Private Repo of Adrian Jones for the UBC class STAT 545a.  It will have a bit about me as well as some info on how I worked on it.


### Intro to Me

Hi, I'm Adrian.  
I'm a new student in the Masters of Statistics program.  I did my undergrad several years ago in Environmental Science with a minor in Statistics.  Since then I've gravitated more towards data manipulation and processing as a very enjoyable work, despite the many frustrations.  I first encountered this sort of activity in a 200 level introduction to MATLAB course and haven't looked back since.

I spend most of my hobby time practising and teaching european historical marial arts, focussing primarily on the rapier (a al Princess Bride) though I also dabble in sidesword, longsword and poleaxe.
This can all be done in Vancouver at [Academie Duello](http://www.academieduello.com/)


I also enjoy tabletop gaming.  Some board games I enjoy are, in no particular order:

* Smallworld
* Shadowrun: Crossfire 
* Battlestar Galactica
* Smash Up

[Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun) is currently my preferred pen and paper RPG, though I'm also partial to the (FATE system)[http://www.faterpg.com] and for short pick up games that need no GM [Fiasco](http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/) is amazing.


### Stuff I did to make this happen
1. Created a project on github explisitly for this.
2. Pulled that to my clunker laptop, and then push and pull as necessary
3. Spent some time reading the various links about homework on the homework page
4. Read up on markdown in a variety of places

### Things I think about Markdown
* It is very useful to be able to toss R code into the main line of the script
* Doing word processing equivilent (like this README) seems less eficient than something designed for the purpose (No spell check, not WISIWIG, )

####Update Log (maybe these should be the comments to pushes?  But then how do I keep track before the commit?  Maybe cut and paste from here to there)

2015/18/09 1430hrs.  I've pulled the README.md file from the public repo PrepPrivateStat545a on GitHub to my personal computer.

2015/18/09 1620hrs.  Back to work.  I pushed up to Git when I finished  and went off to do some other wrk. I pulled down as a habit forming gesture even though I know it should be all the same.  I look into links and some Formatting and add a bit more content.

2015/20/09 1400hrs.  I set up the prep project in my home tower by starting a new project in RStudio and then doing version control to the public github repo. Thats about it really, I had to head off afterwards.
